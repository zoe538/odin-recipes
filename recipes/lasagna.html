    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>For those nights when you're lacking in time and motivation, pull out this no-fail recipe. It'll save the dayâ€”or night. This recipe has everything you expect in a classic lasagna: ground beef, tomatoes, noodles, and a delicious selection of cheeses (mozzarella, cottage cheese or ricotta, and Parmesan). But the method is where this recipe stands above others.</p>
    <p>We tasked our recipe pros with finding ingredients and shortcuts that cut down on the work of putting this lasagna together but don't sacrifice any of the flavor. Browning the ground beef, perhaps the longest task besides baking, takes just 5 to 7 minutes. Once all the sauce ingredients are added to the beef, you'll only need to simmer a few minutes, not hours like the typical lasagna recipe.</p>
